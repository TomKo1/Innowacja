        authorizes the lawful owner. As soon as the private key of an account is given to

        money. However, the result is always the same: The proof of work is expensive.

        the majority of the systemâ€™s computational power is controlled by honest nodes.
        However, in small peer-to-peer systems with a limited computational power, that
        majority can still be very small, which in turn could make it possible to perform
        a 51 percent attack. This problem is in particularly relevant for cryptocurrencies
        with low market capitalization and limited user adoption. Hence, any blockchain
        will require a critical mass of honest nodes to support it and make it resistant to
        attackers with a lot of computational power. Reaching a critical size that makes
        51 percent attacks impossible is a challenge that every new blockchain has to
        face.`,
